Inca Empire<br><br>
The Incas were a civilization that existed over 500 years ago. They lived in western South America. They had the largest part of the empire in the Americas before the colonists showed up. The Incan art, architecture and adaption of landscapes were some of their impressive feats.<br> <br>The Incas were originally a small tribe in the southern highlands of Peru. In less than a century, during the 1400s, they built one of the largest, most tightly controlled empires the world has ever known. <br><br>
History<br><br>
	The Origins of the Incas is hard to uncover from all the legends and myths. The capital of the Inca civilization, Cuzco, has been inhabited since 4500 BC. Uniting the region to become the Inca Empire didn't start until 141th century. In the late 15th century the first leader of the Inca, Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui rose to power after the defeat of the Chanca, who were an opposing tribe. After the Pachacuti came to power the Incas started to expand with the purpose of conquering new land.<br><br>
Culture<br><br>
After conquering vast lands, people who could speak the language of the Incas were given privilege status. The Incas prized their buidings and their art. Their art was inspired by the previous Chimu Civilization. The Incas really enjoyed implementing metal work and geometry in their artwork.<br><br>
Government<br><br>
The Incas kept records of their kings and their accomplishments. There might have been two kings ruling at one time due to some overlap in the Inca records. The Inca mummified their kings after they have died. These mummies were stored in Coricanch Temple in the city of Cuzco. The government was set up like a bunch of interlocking units. The king is at the top then below him are the nobles. This made it like a pyramid of power. <br><br>
Religion<br><br>
Two tribes were contributers to the Inca religion, The Wari Tribe and The Tiwanaku. Due to the sites of Tiwanaku and Lake Titicaca were major places of the myths of their creation. Inti, The Sun God, The Supreme Inca deity, and The Moon Goddess Mama Kilya had shrines built for them. Religious ceremonies took place according to the astronomical calender, especially the movements of the sun and the moon. They worshipped a god of the harvest and their ancestors.
